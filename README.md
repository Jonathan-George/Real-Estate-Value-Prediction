# Real-Estate-Value-Prediction

In this analytics project, using the Real Estate Data Chicago 2024 from Kaggle, I used a Linear Regression Model to forecast the prices of Real Estate in Chicago, given a number of independent variables.

My model R-Squared score produced an 89.8% accuracy in determining the value of Real Estate in Chicago... But i decided to also get a Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) for my model and compare it against a baseline RMSE and the result showed that my Model performs better than baseline,which means that my predictive model has a lower error or higher accuracy compared to a baseline model..
